# EmotionalType Creative Usage Demo

This project is a showcase of the Emotional Variable Font, featuring interactive and educational content about the ancient Tamil civilization. It demonstrates creative uses of variable fonts for both word-based and line-based highlighting, making history engaging and visually dynamic.

## Features

- **Article View** (`index.html`):
  - A detailed, research-backed history of the Tamil people, their culture, and achievements.
  - Uses the Emotional Variable Font for section headings and emphasis.

- **Word Highlight Demo** (`word-highlight.html`):
  - Hover over any word to see the font animate between negative and positive weights.
  - The entire article content is split into word spans for interactive exploration.

- **Line Highlight Demo** (`line-highlight.html`):
  - Hover over any sentence to see the emotional font effect.
  - Sentences are split and highlighted individually for a unique reading experience.
